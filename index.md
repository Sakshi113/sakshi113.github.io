My name is Kalpesh Krishna, and I'm a senior undergraduate student of Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in). I intend to use this blog for technical purposes and a few life hacks.

To get an insight on my academic life so far, you can have a look at my [CV](http://home.iitb.ac.in/~kalpesh1729/resume.pdf) or my [Github profile](https://github.com/martiansideofthemoon).

You can head over to my [blog](http://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/archive.html) or read a bit [more about me](http://martiansideofthemoon.github.io/about/).
