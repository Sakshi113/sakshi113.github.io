My name is Kalpesh Krishna, and I will be starting a PhD in Computer Science at [UMass Amherst](http://cs.umass.edu/) in Fall 2018. I recently graduated from the Electrical Engineering department at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in).

I maintain a list of my publications and research implementations under the [Research]({{ site.url }}/research) tab. To get an insight on my professional life so far, you can have a look at my [CV]({{ site.url }}/assets/cv_long.pdf).
