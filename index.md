My name is Kalpesh Krishna, and I am a first year PhD in Computer Science at [UMass Amherst](http://cs.umass.edu/). I recently graduated from the Electrical Engineering department at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in).

I maintain a list of my publications and research implementations under the [Research]({{ site.url }}/research) tab. To get an insight on my professional life so far, you can have a look at my [CV]({{ site.url }}/cv).

I [blog]({{ site.url }}/archive) every now and then compiling my personal experiences. Feel free to read a bit [more about me]({{ site.url }}/about)!
