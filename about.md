### Bio

My name is Kalpesh Krishna, and I'm a senior undergraduate student of Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in). I used to lead a club at IIT Bombay, namely [The Web and Coding Club](https://www.facebook.com/wncc.iitb/), where we help people get started with code. I am interested in Language Processing, Computer Graphics and enthusiastic about Computer Science in general.  
This summer, I worked on end-to-end speech recognition at [TTIC](http://ttic.edu/), which is a computer science graduate institute at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/). Last summer, I contributed to [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla)'s Automation Team via [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [Quarter of Contribution](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution).

In my free time I contribute to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5080995/martianwars) and to our club's [wiki](http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki), a beginner's programming guide. I love cycling, and I have a cool little collection of Rubiks puzzles! Unfortunately, I'm not so good at solving them!

Some people on the internet also know me as *martianwars*.
