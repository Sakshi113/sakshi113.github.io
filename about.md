### Bio

My name is Kalpesh Krishna, and I'm a junior undergraduate student of Electrical Engineering at [IIT Bombay](http://iitb.ac.in). I lead a club at IIT Bombay, namely [The Web and Coding Club](https://www.facebook.com/wncc.iitb/), where we help people get started with code. I am interested in Language Processing, Computer Graphics and enthusiastic about Computer Science in general. Last summer, I contributed to [Mozilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla)'s Automation Team via [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and [Quarter of Contribution](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Auto-tools/New_Contributor/Quarter_of_Contribution).

In my free time I contribute to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/5080995/martianwars) and to our club's [wiki](http://wncc-iitb.org/wiki), a beginner's programming guide. I love cycling, and I have a cool little collection of Rubiks puzzles! Unfortunately, I'm not so good at solving them!

### Why *Martian*?

I first got the idea of adding 'Martian' in my online identity while making my Skype account back in 2010. I was tired of the standard usernames like *kalpeshk2006* and *kalpeshkrishna2009* and I wanted something that would stand out. Luckily, at that moment I was listening to songs on Pink Floyd's album [The Dark Side of the Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon). I was never a fan of the music, but the title and artwork intrigued me. It also gave me my first unique online userID, [martiansideofthemoon](https://github.com/martiansideofthemoon).

It's been like this ever since. People often found *martiansideofthemoon* a little difficult to type, so I cut it down to *martianwars*, during my IRC conversations with Mozilla. A lot of people have found the name interesting and I'm definitely planning to stick to it!

*The Last Martian* has nothing to do with the movie or book [The Martian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)). It's just an apt webpage name for a person in love with Mars!
