I am broadly interested in Speech and Language Processing. In the modality with a speech I have a special focus on making supervised and self-supervised learning in speech and audio amenable to resource constratined scenarios (both data and compute). Currently I am also working on achieving domain invariance in supervised and self-supervised learning in speech. In the modality of text , I like working on the topics of content moderation and information extraction. I am currently focused on making deep learning models for detecting complex entities in text and help detect implicit hate speech in online conversations.

I am excited to see what multiple modalities together can offer (speech, text and graphs).
