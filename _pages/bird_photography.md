I've recently gotten into bird watching and photography (during the COVID-19 quarantine period in June 2020). It started off as backyard birding but has now developed into a more serious hobby and I enjoy exploring the Pioneer Valley trying to ID and photograph birds. I maintain my [life list](https://ebird.org/profile/MTgwMDY0OQ/world) on eBird. In this page I will post some photographs of birds along with the camera settings used for the shot. All photographs have been taken using a Canon EOS 90D with a Sigma 100-400mm DG OS HSM lens (unless specified otherwise).
