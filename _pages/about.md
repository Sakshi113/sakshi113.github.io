My name is Sreyan Ghosh, and I am a Software Engineer II at [Cisco Systems, Bangalore](www.cisco.com). I am interested in low-resource Speech and Language Processing. I work under the guidance of [Prof. Umesh S.](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~umeshs/) at [Speech Lab, Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/speech/lab/) and [Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn) at [MIDAS Labs at IIIT Delhi](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/).

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at [Christ University](https://christuniversity.in/) in 2020. I served as the Vice President and co-founder of Neuron, Christ University's first AI group focused on research and hackathons.
