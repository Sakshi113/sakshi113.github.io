My name is Sakshi. I am currently a 1st year C.S. Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Prof. Ramani Duraiswami](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RCmfc0cAAAAJ&hl=en) at [PIRL Lab](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/labs/pirl/) and [Prof. Dinesh Manocha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X08l_4IAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Gamma Lab](https://gamma.umd.edu/) on audio and language processing. Currently I am working on improving complex reasoning tasks in audio and natural language models. I completed my M.S. from UMass Amherst in 2022 where I worked with [Prof. Ethan Zuckerman](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1lvJXKQAAAAJ&hl=en) on Extreme Speech detection on YouTube. Previous to UMass, I served as a Software Engineer II at [Cisco Systems, Bangalore](http://cisco.com). My primary work at Cisco involved building network assurance software systems for Cisco's Service Provider customers. My currrent research focuses on deep learning for audio processing, with a focus on building efficient models and the integration of language as a tool to improve the performance of audio processing tasks.
