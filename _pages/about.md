My name is Sreyan Ghosh. I am currently an M.S. C.S. student at the University of Maryland, College Park. Previous to this I served as a Deep Learning Solutions Architect at [Nvidia, Bangalore](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/). My primary work at Nvidia involved building and delivering deep learning based NLP solutions to Nvidia's customers and partners. Previously to that, I served as a Software Engineer II at [Cisco Systems, Bangalore](http://cisco.com).

At UMCP, I work under the guidance of [Prof. Dinesh Manocha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X08l_4IAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Gamma Lab](https://gamma.umd.edu/) at UMCP. Previously, I was fortunate to have worked under the guidance of [Prof. Umesh S.](http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~umeshs/) at [Speech Lab, Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/speech/lab/) and [Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/rajivratn) at [MIDAS Labs at IIIT Delhi](http://midas.iiitd.edu.in/).

I graduated with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering at [Christ University](https://christuniversity.in/) in 2020. I served as the Vice President and co-founder of Neuron, Christ University's first AI group focused on research and hackathons.
