My name is Sakshi. I am currently a C.S. Ph.D. student at the University of Maryland, College Park. Previously, I served as a Deep Learning Solutions Architect at [Nvidia, Bangalore](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/). My primary work at Nvidia involved building and delivering deep learning based NLP solutions to Nvidia's customers and partners. Previously to that, I served as a Software Engineer II at [Cisco Systems, Bangalore](http://cisco.com). My primary work at Cisco involved building network assurance software systems for Cisco's Service Provider customers. Beyond Software Engineering, I am interested in Speech and Language Processing. At UMCP, I work under the guidance of [Prof. Dinesh Manocha](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=X08l_4IAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Gamma Lab](https://gamma.umd.edu/) on various problems in speech and audio processing.

I maintain a list of my publications and research implementations under the [Research]({{ site.url }}/research) tab. I also [blog]({{ site.url }}/archive) about my personal experiences and topics related to speech and text processing. I am always open to collaborations, and please feel free to drop me a mail!
