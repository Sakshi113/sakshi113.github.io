This is my first blogpost and I'm extremely happy to announce that "The Last Martian" (yes that's me) has been selected for [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) this year!

## But, What is GSoC?

GSoC, standing for Google Summer of Code, is a program happening once a year between the months of May and August. It's meant to promote open source development. Google funds a number of open source projects under some open source organizations, for everyone's benefit. There is a lot of money involved, and not to forget the awesome goodies!

## So, What's My Project?

The organization I have been selected for is [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), the brilliant workforce behind the popular browser [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/).
More specifically, I will be working with the [Engineering Productivity](https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity)(we call ourselves the "A-Team") team. Our major goal is to improve the testing infrastructure for Firefox and other Mozilla products through several tools and services aimed at improving the overall productivity of engineers in Mozilla.
