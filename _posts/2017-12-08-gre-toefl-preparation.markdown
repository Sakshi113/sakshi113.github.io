I recently gave the GRE and TOEFL exams in preparation for MS / PhD applications. While there exist several excellent resources to help you prepare ([Magoosh](https://magoosh.com/), [Princeton Review](https://www.princetonreview.com/), [Manhattan](https://www.manhattanprep.com/gre/)), I thought it would be useful to share my personal experience with both tests. I might write a blog on grad school admission in the future (of course, conditioned on the admits I get!)

## Introduction

GRE and TOEFL are necessary exams for most graduate college applications abroad. GRE is a test of basic quantitive skills, verbal skills (primarily vocabulary, comprehension and inference) and essay writing. Most engineering students find the quantitive section really easy, but struggle with verbal and essay writing. TOEFL (iBT - internet Based Test) is a simple test of reading, writing, listening and speaking skills. TOEFL is generally a lot easier than GRE. People trained in an english-medium school or college generally sail through TOEFL without much preparation.

## GRE - Graduate Record Exam

The GRE is scored out of 340 marks - 170 marks quant, 170 marks verbal. Additionally, your essay writing skills are manually evaluated out of 6 marks. For engineering graduate programs, a score of 325+ is considered *safe*, with close to full marks in quant. In essay writing, a score of 4+ is considered *safe*. How much does your GRE score matter? This varies a lot across universities, but popular opinion (and several admission guides like [Philip Guo's](http://www.pgbovine.net/grad-school-app-tips.htm) and [Mor Harchol-Balter's](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf)) says it's just used as a threshold in higher ranked universities.

Additionally, a few streams (like Physics) might need a Subject GRE. This is not needed for Computer Science or Electrical Engineering programs.

### Choosing a Date

I gave my GRE exam on 28th August, 2017 (for reference, my graduate applications were due in December 2017), and registered for it on 27th June, 2017. June to October are rush-hours, and it's often hard to get weekend slots. Try to book 3-4 months in advanced. Payment require credit card (keep one handy, it is needed for graduate applications too), and the cost is a whopping 205$!

### GRE Preparation

I tried to study for GRE during my summer internship, but couldn't do much beyond understanding the exam pattern. I started off with [these](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B36C1JLEtF-7d3c1VUppWVFIUGs) Magoosh videos (download them quickly before they are taken off!). I recommend fully understanding the different question types and exam pattern before venturing into hardcore preparation. resumed my GRE preparation between 24th and 30th July, and finally 5th August to 27th August (examination day). I would have loved to prepare for 1-2 weeks more, but I am happy with the final outcome.

#### Preparation Material

I used four books in all, the official ETS material and Barron's books. Additionally, I used the two free online tests (everyone gets them during registration). If you are up for a challenge, I recommend the Manhattan verbal books.

#### Diagnostic Test

I started my preparation with a diagnostic test, a zero-preparation evaluation of where you stand.
