It's been a fun week and I'm really enjoying myself this GSoC. Quite a productive one, and I discovered an excellent new sport, cycling!

I've always loved the [Pokémon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon) video games and my recent completion of [HeartGold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_HeartGold_and_SoulSilver) brought back these fond memories. I dedicate this week's theme to Pokémon, with my two favourite starter Pokémon engaged in a fierce battle!
