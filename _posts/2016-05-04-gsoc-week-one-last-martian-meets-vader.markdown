I've been absolutely obsessed with Star Wars, especially Darth Vader this week. I've named my Pull Requests after him, the video chat room with [Armen](https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/armenzg/). It's probably because I just saw the awesome seventh movie in the series!

In any case, let's get back to how the week worked for me.
