It's been a really hectic week, and unfortunately I could not do too much GSoC work, but I'm very much on track. At the end of this week, I gifted a friend my favourite fantasy story, [Eragon](http://www.alagaesia.com/books_detail.php?book=eragon), the first book of the Inheritance Cycle. With sweet memories, I'll dedicate this week's theme to Saphira, the first dragon in the Inheritance Cycle.
