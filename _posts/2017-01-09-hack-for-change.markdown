I took part in [Hack for Change](https://hackforchange.io) yesterday at *The Garage*, Mumbai with my co-manager [Kumar Ayush](https://github.com/cheekujodhpur/). We were also co-sponsors of the hackathon and brought along our team to help out with the logistics.  It was a great day, and we ended at fourth place (tough luck!). Feels great to take part in a hackathon after 2 years!

Here's a picture of the T-Shirt - (Yay! WnCC got its logo on it)
