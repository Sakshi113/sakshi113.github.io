It's been a busy week. I've been busy with college work and I did a bit of GSoC work too this week.

So this week's theme HAS to be [Game of Thrones](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/), because they've just produced the most heartbreaking twist in the story, and keeping some other theme would just dirrespect brilliant television show (since I follow it actively).

I dedicate this week to [Hodor](http://gameofthrones.wikia.com/wiki/Hodor), who had one task (to Hold the Door - "Ho-Dor"), and he held on, sacrificing himself, bringing tears to millions of fans.
